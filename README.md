# U.S. Crime Exploratory Dataset Analysis
In this repository, I have included a dataset that contains data about U.S. crime rates and types from the years 1975-2015 by city. In order to begin visualizing this data, I first wanted to organize the data by the highest crime rates per capita at the
starting point of the sample dataset (the year 1975) and compare it to the end year (2015) to see if there were major changes.

And so, I first asked the question: 
### Which cities have the highest crime per capita rates in 1975 v.s. 2015?

From this, I saw that Baltimore, Maryland was included in the 5 cities with the highest crime per capita rates in both 1975 and 2015.

I then chose to further explore crime in Baltimore, MD. So then, I asked the question: 
### Which years had the highest crimes_percaptia in Baltimore, MD?

I then was able to see which years had the highest per capita crime rates in Baltimore.

Lastly, I wanted to isolate a type of crime that had happened in Maryland and see the years when the rate for this crime had been the highest, as well as creating a graph to visualize the rates of this crime from 1975-2015. I chose the crime 'robbery'
in order to do this, and finally asked the question:
### Which years were robbery rates the highest in Baltimore, MD from 1975 - 2015?

I then displayed the top 20 years in a table, and created a visualization using a bar graph.
